# voxl_mpa_to_ros

ROSNode that takes in mpa data and published it to ROS

#### Installation
Install mpa-to-ros by installing the latest version of voxl-nodes
```
opkg install voxl-nodes
```

It is strongly recommended that you install voxl-mpa-tools while using mpa-to-ros as the library contains a plethora of useful tools to ensure that mpa is working properly.

```
opkg install voxl-mpa-tools
```


#### Start Installed MPA ROS Node
```
bash
export ROS_IP=`hostname -i`
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
roslaunch voxl_mpa_to_ros voxl_mpa_to_ros.launch
```
In order for ros topics to actually appear, you must make sure that the relative
mpa server is started. You can use voxl-inspect-services from the mpa-tools library
to see a list of available services, and use opkg to install any that are not visible there.
You can start/stop these services at any point while mpa to ros is running and it will close
and open advertisements approprtiately

The current supported mpa->ros translations are:  

-Tracking and stereo cameras from voxl-camera-server  

-Imu0 and Imu1 from voxl-imu-server  

-VIO data from voxl-qvio-server (the data will appear under the qvio name, but it is normal vio data)
